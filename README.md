## What is Queuing Theory?

Queuing theory is a branch of mathematics that studies how lines form, how they <br>
function, and why they malfunction. Queuing theory examines every component of <br>
waiting in line, including the arrival process, service process, number of servers, <br>
number of system places, and the number of customersâ€”which might be people, data <br>
packets, cars, or anything else.<br>
